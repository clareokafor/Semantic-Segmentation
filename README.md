# Semantic-Segmentation


This project explores the comparative effectiveness of three prominent architectures: FCN, PSPNet, and U-Net. By implementing and evaluating these models, I gain valuable insights into their strengths and limitations. Augmentation techniques introduce diverse image manipulations, enhancing our understanding of segmentation challenges. Hyperparameter optimization plays a pivotal role in shaping model performance, allowing for significant accuracy improvements. Evaluation metrics provide insights for model comparison and identification of areas for improvement.
